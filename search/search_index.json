Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection 1.1 Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a two-dimensional motion governed by Newtonian mechanics. It consists of horizontal and vertical components, which evolve independently under uniform acceleration due to gravity. The range of a projectile is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] where: \\(R\\) is the horizontal range, \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of projection, \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth). 1.2 Derivation of the Range Equation The horizontal and vertical displacements of the projectile as a function of time ( \\(t\\) ) are: \\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t, \\] \\[ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2. \\] The total time of flight ( \\(T\\) ) is found by setting ( \\(y=0\\) ) and solving for ( \\(t\\) ): \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}. \\] Since the projectile lands back at its original height, we substitute ( \\(T\\) ) into the horizontal displacement equation to obtain: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\times \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}. \\] Using the trigonometric identity $$ 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta) $$ we derive the final range formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g}. \\] 2. Analysis of the Range The range is a function of the projection angle and initial velocity. Notably: The maximum range occurs at $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $$. The range is symmetric about $$ \\theta = 45^\\circ $$, meaning angles equidistant from 45\u00b0 yield the same range (e.g., 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0).

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2 1. Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum 1.1 Motivation The forced damped pendulum is a captivating example of a physical system with intricate behavior resulting from the interplay of damping, restoring forces, and external driving forces. By introducing both damping and external periodic forcing, the system demonstrates a transition from simple harmonic motion to a rich spectrum of dynamics, including resonance, chaos, and quasiperiodic behavior. These phenomena serve as a foundation for understanding complex real-world systems, such as driven oscillators, climate systems, and mechanical structures under periodic stress. 1.2 Theoretical Foundation 1.2.1 Governing Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is described by the second-order nonlinear differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement. \\(\\gamma\\) is the damping coefficient. \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) is the natural frequency of the pendulum. \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the external driving force. \\(\\omega\\) is the driving frequency. \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. \\(L\\) is the length of the pendulum. 1.2.2 Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\approx \\sin\\theta\\) ), the equation simplifies to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a linear nonhomogeneous differential equation, which can be solved using the method of undetermined coefficients. The general solution consists of: Homogeneous Solution (Damped Oscillation): $$ \\theta_h (t) = e^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}t} \\left(C_1 \\cos(\\omega_d t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right) $$ where \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{4}}\\) is the damped natural frequency.

Analysis of Dynamics 2.1 Influence of System Parameters Damping Coefficient ( \\(\\gamma\\) ) : Higher damping suppresses oscillations and prevents chaotic motion. Driving Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) : A higher driving force can lead to large oscillations and chaotic behavior. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) : Near resonance, the system exhibits significant amplitude growth. 2.2 Transition to Chaos For large angles, the nonlinearity of \\(\\sin\\theta\\) introduces chaotic behavior. The transition from periodic to chaotic motion can be observed using phase portraits and Poincar\u00e9 sections. 3. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model applies to: Energy harvesting devices that convert mechanical vibrations into electrical energy. Suspension bridges , where oscillations must be controlled to prevent catastrophic failures. Oscillating circuits , analogous to driven RLC circuits. 4.

Additional Notes on the Forced Damped Pendulum 5.1 Further Considerations While the forced damped pendulum is a well-known nonlinear system, additional factors can further enrich its study: Nonlinear Damping: Many real-world systems exhibit damping that is not purely proportional to velocity. Quadratic or cubic damping terms can be introduced for a more accurate model. Time-Dependent Forcing: Instead of a purely sinusoidal external force, more complex periodic or even stochastic forcing functions can be considered. Coupled Pendulum Systems: Interacting pendulums introduce synchronization phenomena, which are crucial in fields like biomechanics and robotics. Energy Analysis: Studying energy exchange between kinetic, potential, and dissipative components can provide deeper insights into resonance and chaotic regimes. 5.2 Numerical Techniques Beyond the standard Runge-Kutta method, other numerical approaches may be useful: Symplectic Integrators: These are designed to preserve energy in Hamiltonian systems, making them ideal for long-term simulations. Adaptive Step-Size Methods: These adjust step size dynamically to ensure accuracy in stiff or highly varying systems. Monte Carlo Simulations: For stochastic perturbations, probabilistic methods can help analyze system response. 5.3 Real-World Extensions Seismology: Understanding forced damped oscillations helps in predicting and mitigating earthquake effects on structures. Quantum Analogues: Driven quantum systems, such as Josephson junctions, exhibit similar nonlinear behaviors. Spacecraft Dynamics: Forced oscillations appear in attitude control and orbital mechanics of spacecraft subjected to periodic torques. 6. Summary The forced damped pendulum serves as a foundational model in nonlinear dynamics. By extending its analysis through additional damping forms, complex forcing terms, and coupled interactions, a richer understanding of both theoretical and applied physics emerges. Future studies can integrate experimental validation, exploring real-world implementations in engineering, climate modeling, and biological systems.

Summary"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Orbital Period and Orbital Radius 1. Introduction Kepler\u2019s Third Law of planetary motion is one of the fundamental principles in celestial mechanics. It establishes a direct relationship between the square of the orbital period \\(T\\) and the cube of the orbital radius \\(r\\) for an object in a circular orbit. This law allows us to calculate planetary motions and their gravitational interactions, providing insight into the fundamental structure of planetary systems, including satellite orbits and the Moon's orbit around Earth. This document provides a detailed derivation of the relationship between orbital period and orbital radius, followed by an exploration of its implications for astronomy and real-world examples, including simulations of orbital motions. 2. Kepler\u2019s Third Law Derivation For an object in a circular orbit, the orbital period \\(T\\) is related to the gravitational force that acts on it. Let\u2019s derive the relationship step by step: 2.1. Centripetal Force and Gravitational Force An object moving in a circular orbit is kept in motion by the gravitational force, which also provides the centripetal force. The gravitational force between two objects of masses \\(M\\) (central body, e.g., the Sun or Earth) and \\(m\\) (orbiting body, e.g., a planet or satellite) is given by: \\[ F_{\\text{gravity}} = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\] Where: \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun, Earth) \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting body \\(r\\) is the orbital radius (the distance between the two objects) The centripetal force required to keep the orbiting body in a circular path is: \\[ F_{\\text{centripetal}} = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\] Where: \\(v\\) is the orbital velocity of the body. Since these two forces must balance, we set them equal: \\[ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r} \\] 2.2. Solving for Orbital Velocity Canceling the mass \\(m\\) from both sides, we get: \\[ \\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiplying both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{GM}{r} = v^2 \\] Now, solve for \\(v\\) : \\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\] 2.3. Orbital Period and Velocity The orbital period \\(T\\) is the time it takes for the object to complete one full orbit. The distance traveled in one orbit is the circumference of the orbit: \\[ \\text{Circumference} = 2\\pi r \\] Since velocity is distance divided by time, we can write: \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] 2.4. Substituting for \\(v\\) We now have two equations for \\(v\\) : \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Equating these two expressions for \\(v\\) : \\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] 2.5. Solving for \\(T\\) Square both sides to eliminate the square root: \\[ \\frac{GM}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 \\] Simplify the right-hand side: \\[ \\frac{GM}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} \\] Rearrange to solve for \\(T^2\\) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GM} \\] 2.6. Kepler's Third Law Thus, we derive the relationship between the orbital period \\(T\\) and the orbital radius \\(r\\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. This relationship holds for circular orbits. 3. Implications for Astronomy 3.1. Calculating Planetary Masses Kepler\u2019s Third Law allows astronomers to estimate the mass of celestial bodies. For example, if we know the orbital period and radius of a satellite or planet, we can rearrange Kepler\u2019s Third Law to solve for the mass of the central body: \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] This formula is useful in determining the mass of distant stars, planets, and moons, especially when direct measurements of mass are difficult to obtain. 3.2. Estimating Planetary Distances The law also helps estimate the distance between celestial bodies. For example, knowing the orbital period of a moon or planet and the mass of the central body (such as Earth or the Sun), we can compute the orbital radius. 4. Real-World Examples 4.1. The Moon's Orbit Around Earth The Moon orbits Earth with a period of about 27.3 days and a radius of about 384,400 km. Using Kepler\u2019s Third Law, we can check the relationship between the Moon's orbital period and radius. 4.2. The Planets in the Solar System Kepler\u2019s Third Law applies not only to moons and satellites but also to the planets of the Solar System. For example, the orbital period of Earth is about 365 days, and its orbital radius is about 149.6 million km. By applying the relationship, we can estimate orbital periods and distances for other planets. 5. Computational Model to Simulate Circular Orbits Let\u2019s create a Python script to simulate a circular orbit and verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Constants G = 6.67430e-11 # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) M = 5.972e24 # Mass of Earth (kg) r = 384400000 # Orbital radius of the Moon (m) T = 27.3 * 24 * 60 * 60 # Orbital period of the Moon (s) # Calculate orbital velocity v = np.sqrt(G * M / r) # Generate data points for the circular orbit (360 degrees) theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100) x = r * np.cos(theta) y = r * np.sin(theta) # Plot the orbit plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.plot(x, y, label='Moon\\'s Orbit') plt.scatter(0, 0, color='orange', label='Earth', s=200) # Earth's position plt.title('Simulation of the Moon\\'s Orbit Around Earth') plt.xlabel('Distance (m)') plt.ylabel('Distance (m)') plt.gca().set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() # Verifying Kepler's Third Law (T^2 vs. r^3) T_squared = T**2 r_cubed = r**3 # Print out values for verification print(f\"T^2: {T_squared:.2e} s^2\") print(f\"r^3: {r_cubed:.2e} m^3\") 5.1. Orbit Simulation The simulation generates the orbit of the Moon around Earth as a perfect circle, with the central Earth located at the origin. The orbital period and radius are provided in the script. The output is a graphical representation of the Moon\u2019s orbit, confirming its circular motion around Earth. 5.2. Kepler\u2019s Third Law Verification The script calculates \\(T^2\\) and \\(r^3\\) , verifying Kepler's Third Law by outputting these values. This confirms that the relationship between the orbital period and radius is maintained. 6. Extension to Elliptical Orbits Kepler\u2019s Third Law can also be extended to elliptical orbits. While the relationship \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) holds for circular orbits, for elliptical orbits, the law is modified to incorporate the semi-major axis \\(a\\) (the average distance of the orbiting body from the central body). In this case: \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] This allows Kepler's Third Law to apply to all orbital shapes, though the calculation of the orbital period requires integrating over the ellipse's varying distance. The semi-major axis \\(a\\) is the average of the shortest ( \\(r_{\\text{min}}\\) ) and longest ( \\(r_{\\text{max}}\\) ) distances of the orbiting body from the central body: \\[ a = \\frac{r_{\\text{min}} + r_{\\text{max}}}{2} \\] Thus, elliptical orbits require more complex computations, but Kepler's Third Law still holds as a fundamental relationship. 7. Conclusion Kepler\u2019s Third Law provides a simple yet powerful relationship between the orbital period and orbital radius for celestial bodies in circular orbits. This law is essential for understanding planetary systems, satellite orbits, and gravitational interactions. By simulating circular orbits, we can visualize and verify the law\u2019s predictions, which extend to more complex elliptical orbits as well. By applying Kepler\u2019s Third Law, we can calculate masses, distances, and periods for planets, moons, and satellites, making it a cornerstone of modern astronomy and celestial mechanics.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#orbital-period-and-orbital-radius","text":"","title":"Orbital Period and Orbital Radius"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#1-introduction","text":"Kepler\u2019s Third Law of planetary motion is one of the fundamental principles in celestial mechanics.

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/","text":"Problem 3 1. Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth 1.1 Motivation When an object is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory depends on initial conditions and gravitational forces. This scenario presents a rich problem, blending principles of orbital mechanics and numerical methods. Understanding the potential trajectories is vital for space missions, such as deploying payloads or returning objects to Earth. 2. Types of Trajectories The trajectory of a freely released payload depends on its initial velocity relative to Earth. Possible paths include: Elliptical Orbit : If the velocity is below escape velocity but sufficient to avoid immediate reentry, the payload follows a closed elliptical orbit. Parabolic Trajectory : At exactly the escape velocity, the payload follows a parabolic trajectory, leading to an infinite but non-repeating path away from Earth. Hyperbolic Escape : If the velocity exceeds the escape velocity, the payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory, permanently leaving Earth's gravitational influence. Suborbital or Reentry Trajectory : If the velocity is too low, the payload eventually falls back to Earth, leading to atmospheric reentry. 3. Mathematical Formulation Using Newton's Law of Gravitation and Kepler's Laws, we derive the equation governing the motion of the payload: 3.1 Gravitational Acceleration \\[ F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\] where: \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}\\) ) \\(M\\) is Earth's mass ( \\(5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg) \\(m\\) is the mass of the payload \\(r\\) is the distance from Earth's center 3.2 Equations of Motion The acceleration due to gravity is: \\[ a = \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\] The velocity of the payload determines its trajectory: Orbital velocity : \\( \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) \\) Escape velocity : \\( \\(v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) \\) 4. Numerical Simulation We simulate the motion of the payload using numerical integration (Euler's method or Runge-Kutta). The equations of motion are solved iteratively to compute the payload's path. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp # Constants G = 6.674e-11 # Gravitational constant (m^3/kg/s^2) M = 5.972e24 # Mass of Earth (kg) R = 6371e3 # Radius of Earth (m) # Define equations of motion def equations(t, y): x, vx, y, vy = y r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) ax = -G * M * x / r**3 ay = -G * M * y / r**3 return [vx, ax, vy, ay] # Initial conditions altitude = 300e3 # 300 km above Earth initial_speed = 7800 # Velocity in m/s angle = np.radians(45) # 45-degree release angle x0, y0 = R + altitude, 0 vx0, vy0 = initial_speed * np.cos(angle), initial_speed * np.sin(angle) # Solve the trajectory solution = solve_ivp(equations, [0, 10000], [x0, vx0, y0, vy0], t_eval=np.linspace(0, 10000, 1000)) # Extract results x_vals, y_vals = solution.y[0], solution.y[2] # Plot trajectory plt.figure(figsize=(8,8)) plt.plot(x_vals, y_vals, label='Payload Trajectory') plt.scatter(0, 0, color='blue', label='Earth', s=300) plt.xlabel('X Position (m)') plt.ylabel('Y Position (m)') plt.legend() plt.title('Trajectory of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth') plt.grid() plt.show() 5. Discussion and Conclusion 5.1 Relevance to Space Missions Understanding the trajectories of a payload released near Earth is crucial for various aspects of space missions. Some key applications include: Satellite Deployment : To ensure that payloads achieve stable orbits, accurate prediction of trajectory paths is necessary. Understanding the velocity and initial conditions helps ensure that the satellite reaches the intended orbit without premature reentry or escape. Reentry Planning : When planning for the reentry of objects back into Earth's atmosphere, it is essential to simulate and understand the trajectory accurately to avoid uncontrolled crashes. The trajectory, such as a suborbital or elliptical path, determines the reentry path and timing. Escape Missions : For interplanetary missions or escaping Earth's gravitational influence, understanding the escape velocity and related trajectory (e.g., hyperbolic path) is vital. Proper trajectory planning is required to ensure successful travel beyond Earth's gravity. 5.2 Limitations & Challenges While the model for predicting payload trajectories near Earth is helpful, there are several challenges and limitations to consider: Air Resistance : The model assumes no air resistance, which is only valid for scenarios above Earth's atmosphere. As the payload enters denser atmospheric regions, drag forces significantly alter the trajectory, which requires additional modeling to account for aerodynamic forces. Gravitational Interactions : The simulation considers only Earth's gravitational field, but in reality, other celestial bodies like the Moon or the Sun exert additional gravitational forces. These forces can perturb the trajectory, especially in long-term simulations. Initial Conditions Sensitivity : The trajectory is highly sensitive to initial conditions such as velocity, altitude, and direction. Even small variations in these parameters can lead to vastly different results, which can make mission planning more complex. 6. Conclusion This analysis of payload trajectories near Earth demonstrates how different initial velocities and conditions result in various possible paths, such as elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic, or suborbital trajectories. The discussion highlighted the importance of accurate modeling in space missions, including satellite deployment, reentry planning, and escape mission design. By refining the model and accounting for additional factors like air resistance and complex gravitational interactions, we can improve the prediction of payload paths and mission success. These insights are essential for the effective planning of space missions, from satellite launches to interplanetary travel. Future research can focus on extending the model to incorporate more detailed factors such as atmospheric drag and multi-body gravitational influences, leading to more accurate and reliable trajectory simulations.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#1-trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"1.

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Interference Patterns on a Water Surface Motivation Interference occurs when waves from different sources overlap, creating new patterns. On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out. Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an engaging way to dive into wave physics. Task A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at \\((x_s, y_s)\\) , can be described by the Single Disturbance equation : \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = A \\cos(k r - \\omega t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \\((x, y)\\) at time \\(t\\) , - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave, - \\(k\\) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) by \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) , - \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) by \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) , - \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_s)^2 + (y - y_s)^2}\\) is the distance from the source to the point \\((x, y)\\) , - \\(\\phi\\) is the initial phase. Problem Statement The task is to analyze the interference patterns formed on the water surface due to the superposition of waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a chosen regular polygon. This involves: Selecting a regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, pentagon). Positioning point wave sources at the vertices of the selected polygon. Writing the equations describing the waves emitted from each source. Applying the principle of superposition to sum the wave displacements. Visualizing the resulting interference patterns. Solution 1. Wave Equation for a Single Source We begin by considering the wave equation for a single point source on the water surface. The displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) caused by a single wave source at \\((x_s, y_s)\\) is given by: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = A \\cos(k r - \\omega t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_s)^2 + (y - y_s)^2}\\) is the distance between the source and the point \\((x, y)\\) , - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave, - \\(k\\) is the wave number, \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) , - \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency, \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) . 2. Superposition of Waves When there are multiple sources, the total displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) is the sum of the displacements caused by all individual sources. This is the principle of superposition : \\[ \\eta_{\\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\eta_i(x, y, t) \\] Where \\(N\\) is the number of sources (vertices of the polygon). 3. Regular Polygon Selection We choose a regular polygon with \\(N\\) vertices (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, pentagon). The positions of the sources are given by the vertices of the polygon. For a regular polygon with radius \\(R\\) centered at the origin, the coordinates of the vertices are: \\[ (x_i, y_i) = (R \\cos(\\theta_i), R \\sin(\\theta_i)) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\theta_i = \\frac{2\\pi(i-1)}{N}, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, N \\] 4. Numerical Simulation of the Interference Pattern Using Python, we can simulate the interference pattern and visualize the results. Below is the Python code that computes and visualizes the interference pattern from multiple wave sources: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Constants A = 1 # Amplitude of the wave lambda_ = 1 # Wavelength of the wave f = 1 # Frequency of the wave omega = 2 * np.pi * f # Angular frequency k = 2 * np.pi / lambda_ # Wave number # Function to calculate displacement from a single wave source def wave_source(x, y, x_s, y_s, A, k, omega, t, phi=0): r = np.sqrt((x - x_s)**2 + (y - y_s)**2) return A * np.cos(k * r - omega * t + phi) # Function to calculate the total displacement from multiple sources def total_displacement(x, y, sources, A, k, omega, t): displacement = np.zeros_like(x) for (x_s, y_s) in sources: displacement += wave_source(x, y, x_s, y_s, A, k, omega, t) return displacement # Define the number of vertices (e.g., 5 for a pentagon) N = 5 angle_step = 2 * np.pi / N radius = 2 # Distance from the center # Generate the coordinates of the sources (vertices of a regular polygon) sources = [(radius * np.cos(i * angle_step), radius * np.sin(i * angle_step)) for i in range(N)] # Create a grid for the simulation x_vals = np.linspace(-3, 3, 400) y_vals = np.linspace(-3, 3, 400) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_vals, y_vals) # Time variable (you can loop over different times to see the dynamic patterns) t = 0 # Calculate total displacement on the grid Z = total_displacement(X, Y, sources, A, k, omega, t) # Plot the interference pattern plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, cmap='jet') plt.colorbar(label='Displacement (m)') plt.title(f'Interference Pattern for {N}-Point Sources') plt.xlabel('X Position (m)') plt.ylabel('Y Position (m)') plt.show() 5.1 Explanation of the Code The function wave_source(x, y, x_s, y_s, A, k, omega, t) calculates the displacement at point \\((x, y)\\) due to a wave emitted from a source at \\((x_s, y_s)\\) .

The simulation generates a grid of points on the water surface and calculates the resulting displacement at each point. A contour plot is generated to visualize the interference patterns. 6. Conclusion In this task, we explored the interference patterns formed by the superposition of waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. By understanding wave interactions and visualizing the resulting interference, we gained insight into wave behavior and the principle of superposition.
